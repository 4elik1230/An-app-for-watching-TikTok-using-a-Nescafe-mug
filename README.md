"How does the program work?" - When I run the main.py file, your webcam turns on. Then, go to TikTok and point your mug at the camera, and the program will scroll through the video.

Libraries required for the program to work:
1. open-cv
2. pyautogui
3. numpy

"How does all this work?" - when you show a circle the program will recognize the circle with the photo.png file there is a photo of the circle, you can change the photo to your circle but only your mug must be on a transparent background, and if the matches with your circle and photo more than 15 the program presses the key 'down arrow', Also know if for example your background is the same color as your mug that program may mistakenly think you are showing a mug.
